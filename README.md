Currently, the app has one page where users can type in the details of the item they wish to add to the inventory.

# Future Work

Some things I need to fix, improve, and add in the future are:
* Add more pages such as Homepage, Search Page, Edit Page, Delete Page, Inventory Page and a navigation structure
* Connect to a database like SQL Lite for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data on an inventory item
