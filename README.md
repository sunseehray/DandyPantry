# Overview

DandyPantry is a food storage inventory tracking app developed using Android Studio with Kotlin. This app helps users add items to their inventory including a name, quantity, unit cost, and notes. 
Currently, the app has one page where users can type in the details of the item they wish to add to the inventory.
